# Swimming-Pool-Plant-Calculator

# Project Description
This program performs the necessary calculations to manually dose a swimming pool to ensure it has sufficent chemical levels adequate for disinfection and safe for bather comfort.

# Required Information
- Chlorine Concentration (e.g. NaClO â‰ˆ 15%) [Sodium Hypochlorite]
- Pool Volume (or Length, Width & Depth in metres)
- Current Free Chlorine Level (ppm)
- Target Free Chlorine Level (ppm)

# Usage
If your free chlorine is too low, this program helps you to identify how much chlorine you must dose to achieve ideal parameters.

# Future Development
- Specify the pool volume if you already know it.
- Decrease the pH of the pool if it is too high already
- Menu option to modify either Cl or pH
